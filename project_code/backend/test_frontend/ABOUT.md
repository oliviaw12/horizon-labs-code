# Test Frontend Harness (Backend Companion)

This directory contains lightweight HTML/JS harnesses we used to exercise backend chat and quiz endpoints while the real frontend was still under development. It is **not** an automated frontend test suite; instead, it was a quick way to call backend APIs (friction/guidance chat, quiz flow) without waiting on the full UI.

The snippets here were made with help from AI-generation to accelerate backend iteration and manual verification.
