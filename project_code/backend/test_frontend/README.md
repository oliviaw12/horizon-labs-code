# Test Frontend

A minimal static client to exercise the Horizon Labs chat backend. The page streams responses from `/chat/stream`, maintaining conversational state via the `session_id` field.

## Usage

1. Ensure the backend is running and accessible (for example `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`).
2. From this directory, serve the static files. Any simple server works, e.g.

   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 3001
   ```

3. Visit <http://localhost:3001/index.html>. Update the backend URL if needed.
4. Fill in the form and click **Send Message**. The right-hand pane streams tokens as they arrive.
5. Reuse the same session id to keep the conversation history in memory. Click **Reset Session** to clear the in-memory history for the current session id and wipe the streaming output without restarting the backend.
6. Click **Load Persisted History** to call `GET /chat/history` and confirm whether the session has been stored (handy for checking Firestore vs. in-memory mode).

### Adaptive Friction Playground

- Visit <http://localhost:3001/friction.html> to exercise the adaptive friction gate.
- Use the session dropdown to select an existing conversation (pulled from `/chat/sessions`) or create a new session id for ad-hoc testing.
- The page shows the prompt that will be used next, the last prompt served, the number of qualifying learner responses recorded for the active session, and how many more are needed to unlock guidance.
- Use **Refresh State** at any time to query `/debug/friction-state` and confirm the backend counters. Send learner inputs of varying lengths to validate the â‰¥15-word threshold and guidance reset behaviour.
- Click **Load History** to call `/chat/history` and ensure the friction state persists across backend restarts (requires Firestore or the in-memory repository to be active).

> The static client accepts optional context and metadata fields. Metadata must be valid JSON.
