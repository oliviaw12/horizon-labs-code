# Roadmap

Our [product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/dcsil/projects/95/views/1) outlines the planned development and release schedule for our product. It is divided into three main phases: short term, medium term, and long term. Each phase includes specific goals and milestones that we aim to achieve.

This roadmap is not set in stone and may evolve based on user feedback, development progress, and setbacks. We will regularly review and update the roadmap to ensure it aligns with our current vision and strategy.

The current roadmap overview (as of A4) is as follows:

## Short Term

**Duration:** October - November 2025

We intend to ship our MVP which is composed of our 4 CUJs (2 student, 2 instructor). This will allow us to gather user feedback and validate our product concept.

The Short Term tasks can be found in our Github Projects [Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/dcsil/projects/95/views/2).

The issues and milestones currently in work for the MVP are as follows:
- [T1 — Initial Tech Stack Review and ADR Creation](https://github.com/dcsil/Horizon-Labs/issues/96)
- [M0 Foundations](https://github.com/dcsil/Horizon-Labs/milestone/11)
  - [[M0-01] Repo, env & local stack boot](https://github.com/dcsil/Horizon-Labs/issues/42)

  - [Customer Value Proposition and User Research Round 1](https://github.com/dcsil/Horizon-Labs/issues/89)

This section will be updated as issues are completed and new issues are added.

## Medium Term

**Duration:** Late 2025 - Early 2026

We intend to polish and launch our MVP (possibly with additional features) to a small group of users (students and instructors). This will allow us to gather more feedback and validate our product-market fit. We will also extend and test our system in course level pilots at this stage. This phase will also include continued plans for user research and market analysis.

The milestones associated with this phase are as follows:
- [M2 Slide Quiz v1](https://github.com/dcsil/Horizon-Labs/milestone/14)
- [M3 Policies v1](https://github.com/dcsil/Horizon-Labs/milestone/15)
- [M4 Analytics + “LLM TA” v1](https://github.com/dcsil/Horizon-Labs/milestone/16)
- [M5 MVP Hardening & Next Steps](https://github.com/dcsil/Horizon-Labs/milestone/17)
- [R2 — Pricing, Financials Modeling and Projections](https://github.com/dcsil/Horizon-Labs/milestone/24)
- [L2 — MVP Launch](https://github.com/dcsil/Horizon-Labs/milestone/28)
- [Tech Stack Reflections and ADR Update](https://github.com/dcsil/Horizon-Labs/milestone/31)

These milestones and the issues associated with them will move to the Short Term section as tasks are completed.

## Long Term

**Duration:** 2026 and beyond

We intend to complete our course level implementation and begin targeting institution level testing and adoption. We will also explore additional features and integrations based on user feedback and market trends. This phase is outlined in the roadmap board below and does not contain an extensive list of issues yet. Issues will be added as we progress through the Short and Medium Term phase and gather more information.
