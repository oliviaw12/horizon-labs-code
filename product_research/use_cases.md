# JTBDs, CUJs, Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

## JTBDs
- **As a university student**, when engaging with course material (often using digital aids), I want to surface and close my knowledge gaps efficiently while staying within institution policies, so I can save time, retain concepts long-term, and apply them confidently on assessments.
- **As a professor/teacher**, when running a course where students may use AI aids, I want to define allowable use and identify misconceptions across topics, so I can maintain academic standards and adjust instruction to improve learning outcomes.

## CUJs

### Student CUJ 1 — Start a policy compliant study and learning chat
**Statement:** Begin a policy-compliant study chat that adapts to student question quality and maintains state for long term studying.

**User path:**
1. Student opens the Learning Chat module and begins a new study session.
2. Student asks a question → LLM analyzes the questions.
3. LLM does one of the following:  
   a. Good learning question or student has provided some evidence of previous knowledge → LLM answers the question directly and lists some possible follow up topics/questions.  
   b. Bad question (to broad a question) or student has not shown any evidence of learning → LLM provides friction, prompts student to understand what specifically the student doesn't understand and lists possible follow ups (break down the question to get to a good learning question).
4. Before moving to the next question LLM asks a review question having the student actively engage with the recent material.
5. Return to step 2 and repeat.
6. When the student returns to the chat later, the LLM first asks about topics that were mentioned in the last session focusing on problem topics.

### Student CUJ 2 — Start a slide based dynamic quiz session
**Statement:** Upload class slides/materials and take an adaptive, citation-backed quiz that tests understanding and gives recommended next steps.

**User path:**
1. Student opens Quiz → chooses Upload slides (PDF/PPTX).
2. System ingests the file (parse → chunk → index) and shows Ready to quiz.
3. Quiz starts with 6–10 items (MCQ + short answer) generated from the slides.
4. Student answers → system grades instantly, shows a brief explanation with \[slide N] citation, and records correctness + concept tags.
5. The quiz adapts: easier/harder items and topic mix adjust based on recent performance and concept mastery.
6. If rolling accuracy drops (e.g., <60% across last 10 items) or repeated misses on a concept, the system recommends Switch to Study Session, listing 3–5 problem topics and linking to the most relevant slides.
7. Session summary: accuracy by concept, streaks, and next-review steps.

### Instructor CUJ 1 — Configure LLM policies & content scope
**Statement:** Set course-level AI policy and choose what knowledge sources are allowed so student help stays on-policy and aligned to instructional goals.

**User path:**
1. Instructor opens Course → Policy & Sources.
2. Sets Friction level (i.e. min checks before answer) and toggles “require paraphrase before answer.”
3. Chooses Content scope: Course-only, Suggest externals, or Allow externals.
4. Manages Focus list (notes/FAQs to emphasize) and Deny list (assignments/solutions to exclude).  
   a. Upload specific materials for the above lists.
5. Runs a policy check (test prompt): graded-work request is blocked; concept help follows friction rules; answers cite only allowed sources.
6. Presses publish updated and pushing policies to the student side.

### Instructor CUJ 2 — Diagnose class understanding with Analytics + “LLM TA”
**Statement:** View cohort performance by objective/topic and ask LLM TA questions grounded in students’ quiz/chat responses to identify misconceptions.

**User path:**
1. Instructor opens Analytics → Dashboard shows tiles: quiz accuracy/completion and top missed objectives.
2. Open LLM TA pane → ask, e.g., “Why is Objective 2 trending down?” or “What are common confusions about x?”
3. LLM TA retrieves aggregated class data (quiz outcomes, rubric hits/misses, anonymized excerpts) → returns a summary with evidence, suggested misconceptions, and recommended follow-ups.
4. Instructor uses information externally to adjust course plans (i.e. tutorials) and can recommend topics of study to students (Depending on time this could be added to the platform).

## Functional Requirements (FR)

The functional requirements build on the CUJs above. Each CUJ has a set of functional requirements (FR) that define the capabilities needed to support the user journey. This is supported by non-functional requirements (NFR) that define system qualities like performance, scalability, reliability, security, and maintainability.
Each FR and NFR has an ID, description, and acceptance criteria. These requirements are then referenced by Github issues outlining the timeline of our implementation. These issues are then further grouped into milestones representing key phases of development.

**Disclaimer:** These requirements are a starting point and the acceptance criteria is our current prediction/understanding of what needs to be done. They will evolve as we learn more about the problem space, user needs, and technical constraints. Issues will be edited with more details and finalized deadlines once we better understand the work needed. This list also serves as an exhaustive list of features we may want to build, but it is possible not all will be implemented in the initial release. Requirements that are prioritized or pushed back will be reflected in this document and in updates to the milestones/roadmap.

### A) Student CUJ 1 — Policy-compliant Study & Learning Chat (FR-C)

#### FR-C1 — Chat UI (step-by-step coaching)
Provide numbered, reasoning-first guidance (no final solutions for graded work).
**Accept:** Given a coding/problem prompt, the response includes numbered steps and guidance; direct answers to active assignments are refused with a tutorial pivot.

#### FR-C2 — Turn classification
Classify each question as `{good | needs_focusing}` to drive behavior.  
**Accept:** Every turn is labeled and persisted as `{good | needs_focusing}`.

#### FR-C3 — Adaptive friction
When needed, require focus (subtopic or paraphrase) before answers; give concise guidance otherwise.  
**Accept:** `needs_focusing` turns demand a subtopic or ≥15-word paraphrase before a substantive answer; `good` turns receive a concise answer with 2–3 follow-ups.

#### FR-C4 — Active recall and study continuation
Offer a quick micro-check after each turn and prompts for next steps.  
**Accept:** Each turn triggers an MCQ/short-answer to check understanding and/or related questions/suggestions to continue studying.

#### FR-C5 — Memory & revisit
Persist state and start next session from problem topics.  
**Accept:** Sessions resume by referencing the last session’s problem topics/open reviews.

---

### B) Student CUJ 2 — Slide-based Dynamic Quiz (FR-Q)

**Accept:** Subsequent items reflect recent accuracy and concept mastery changes.

#### FR-Q5 — Struggle → study handoff
Recommend study session when sustained struggle is detected.  
**Accept:** If rolling accuracy <60% (last 10) or ≥3 misses on a concept, a study-session recommendation with 3–5 targeted topics and slide links is shown.
