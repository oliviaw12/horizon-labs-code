## Strengths

- Strong problem-solving skills with experience tackling complex technical challenges in both academic and industry settings
- Effective communicator who can explain technical concepts clearly and collaborate across interdisciplinary teams
- Consistent track record of delivering high-quality work while balancing multiple responsibilities as a student and developer

## Weaknesses

- Sometimes take on too much responsibility independently instead of delegating, which can increase workload
- Still building confidence in public speaking and large group presentations compared to smaller team settings
- Can be overly self-critical when work does not meet personal standards, which may slow momentum
