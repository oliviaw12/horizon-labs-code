# Team Principles

## Roles and Responsibilities
Team Leader is responsible for ensuring the team meets deadlines and goals while serving as primary communicator with external stakeholders. (See Team Leader section for more details)
Scrum Master is responsible for leading and facilitating team meetings. They will ensure the team's tasks are being facilitated and completed as per Agile Workflow.
Our team will have members specializing in Frontend and Backend development, however members are expected to be flexible and take on whatever roles are demanded with the release at hand.
This section will be changed and updated as roles are more clearly defined with future work.

## Communication
The primary channel for communication used amongst team members will be a group chat on Discord where we will send and organize files, administer team meetings, and work on deliverables.
Each member of the team is encouraged to ask questions on the group chat as necessary.
The general expectation is to respond to messages as soon as you are able to within a limit of 24 hours, however this is subject to change depending on the importance or urgency of the tasks being communicated. 
For emergencies, we have each group member’s phone numbers pinned in our group Discord chat for texting and calling if they cannot be reached through the primary communication method. 

## Meetings
Our team will have weekly meetings, supplemented by additional meetings as necessary.
During each meeting, one person will be delegated to take notes for future reference.
Members are responsible for attending all team meetings or communicating ASAP if they are not able to. 
In the event of a missing meeting it will be the responsibility of the member to catch up on meeting information through meeting notes. They will also be responsible for responding to any questions or requests that came up during the meeting.

## Work 
We will use Github and/or Jira to keep track of our action items and to-do’s throughout the project.
We will also use Google Drive to store documents such as meeting notes, assignment write-ups, and other files necessary to complete assignments.
During our team meetings, we will make sure to delegate work/responsibilities fairly and regularly touch base with each other on Discord to ensure that everyone is on track. We may hold check-in meetings at least 3 days in advance of deadlines to make sure everyone has done their part. These tasks will be documented via Github issues.
There is an overarching expectation that everyone regularly communicates any issues or obstacles they run into with their task so other members of the group are aware and can help out as necessary.

## Other Principles
This document may not cover everything and is subject to change as the team evolves.
All team members are expected to adhere to these principles and contribute to a positive team environment.
